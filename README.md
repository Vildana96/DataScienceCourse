# DataScienceCourse

Data science course - Beginner

Tutor: Vildana Bakarevic


Are you completely new to Data science? Do you want to start or switch careers to Data Science and Analytics? Or maybe you just need basic knowledge and instructions for a simple university/business Data science project?
If yes, then this is a perfect course for you. This course does not assume any prior knowledge, only motivation to learn.
Probably you have been hearing words like Machine learning, Data Science, Statistics everywhere, but you don't know what they are referring to. In an ocean of online courses and tutorials about these topics, it is hard to choose the right one. Because of their availability, quick and automated implementations started to get more and more important instead of learning the foundations beforehand.   
In this course, we'll cover the fundamental mathematical background and implementations of basic Data science (Machine learning) algorithms in Python. Our opinion is that Data science tools are learned better if you know how they work and then you could apply them in all further projects.
 
What youâ€™ll learn
Understand the basics of Data Science and math behind it
Understand how to use Python for this purpose from begining
Create simple Data science project 
Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?
This course does not have any prerequisites. 
Who this course is for:
Anyone who is highly motivated to learn about Data Science from absolute scratch
Anyone who is just curious to know how Data science works and how it could be used in real world problems
Anyone who wants  to start Data science carrier or wants to take basic advantage of Data science for some particular project
What topics will be covered:
Data preprocessing - data structure and data cleaning
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Feature selection 
Feature correlation
Dimensionality reduction
Regression - loss function and model evaluation
Classification - loss function and model evaluation
Clustering - basic cluster definitions and algorithms

 Setting:

The course will be held in Propeler centar in small groups. Estimated duration of the course is 4 months with 2,5h classes once a week. Exact day and time will be agreed with every group. It is preferable to bring your own laptop. Initially, the course will be taught in Serbian language. Price for the complete course is 400 Euros i.e. 100 Euros per month.



Applications are open and the course could start when at least 5 people apply.
